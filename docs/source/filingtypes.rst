Filing Types
============

The SECEdgar package provides a ``Filing`` class which acts as an API to SEC EDGAR document filings.
This page aims to explain briefly what information is contained in each filing type.

Form 10-K
---------

The 10-K form is an annual report submitted by public companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges. 
As the `SEC explains <https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answers-form10khtm.html>`_, 
"The annual report on Form 10-K provides a comprehensive overview of the 
company's business and financial condition and includes audited financial statements."

Form 10-Q
---------

`According to the SEC <https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answersform10qhtm.html>`_, 
"The Form 10-Q includes unaudited financial statements and provides 
a continuing view of the company's financial position during the year. 
The report must be filed for each of the first three fiscal quarters of the company's fiscal year." 
The 10-Q provides investors regular check-ins to a company's health from quarter to quarter.

Form 8-K
--------

The Form 8-K reports major events that shareholders should know about. The SEC defines various 
events as major. A few highlights include:

- Bankruptcy
- Termination of a "Material Definitive Agreement"
- Notice of delisting
- Material impairments
- Shareholder director nominations
- Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws

For a full list, refer to the `SEC's full list <https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answersform8khtm.html>`_.

Form 13-F
---------

The 13-F form is a holding disclosure by institutional investors who manage at least $100 million USD (e.g. mutual funds, hedge funds, pension funds, etc.).
The form is released quarterly and provides insight into buying behavior. However, these forms can be submitted up to 45 days after 
the end of the quarter. Thus, they are not guaranteed to be up to date with the current holdings by the institutional 
investor. Only certain securities must be included in the Form 13-F. The `full list of securities <https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13flists.htm>`_ 
can be found on the SEC website.

The Form 4 reports changes in ownership by insiders and must be reported to the SEC within two business days.

the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act relating to conflict minerals contained 
in products that reporting companies manufacture or contract to be manufactured and necessary to the 
functionality or production of those products."
