APPLE COMPUTER, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(Unaudited)

1.	Interim information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of 
the Company's management, all adjustments necessary for a fair 
statement of interim results have been included. All adjustments are 
of a normal recurring nature unless specified in a separate note 
included in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The 
results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to 
be expected for the entire year. These financial statements and notes 
should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual 
consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for 
the fiscal year ended September 27, 1996, included in its Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 27, 1996 (the 
"1996 Form 10-K").


2.	In the second quarter of 1996, the Company announced and 
began to implement a restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs and 
restoring profitability to the Company's operations. The restructuring 
plan was necessitated by decreased demand for Company products 
and the Company's adoption of a new strategic direction. These 
actions resulted in a net charge of $179 million after subsequent 
adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter of 1996. In the second 
quarter of 1997, the Company announced and began to implement 
supplemental restructuring actions to meet the foregoing objectives 
of the plan. The Company recognized a $155 million charge in the 
second quarter for the estimated incremental costs of those actions. 
The restructuring actions consist of terminating approximately 3,100 
full-time employees, as adjusted, approximately 2,400 of whom have 
been terminated from the second quarter of 1996 through June 27, 
1997, excluding employees who were hired by SCI Systems, Inc. and 
MCI Systemhouse, the purchasers of the Company's Fountain, 
Colorado manufacturing facility and the Napa, California data center 
facility, respectively; canceling or vacating certain facility leases as a 
result of those employee terminations; writing down certain land, 
buildings and equipment to be sold as a result of downsizing 
operations and outsourcing various operational functions; and 
canceling contracts for projects and technologies that are not central 
to the Company's core business strategy. The restructuring actions 
under the plan have resulted in cash expenditures of $135 million 
and noncash asset write-downs of $32 million 
from the second quarter of 1996 through June 27, 1997. During the 
third quarter of 1997, the Company made adjustments to the 
categories and timing of expected restructure spending based on 
revised estimates. The Company expects that the remaining $167 
million accrued balance at June 27, 1997 will result in cash 
expenditures of approximately $100 million over the next twelve 
months and $12 million thereafter. The Company expects that most 
of the contemplated restructuring actions related to the plan will be 
completed within the next six months and will be financed through 
current working capital and, if necessary, continued short-term 
borrowings.

3.	On February 4, 1997, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares
of NeXT Software, Inc. ("NeXT"). NeXT, headquartered in Redwood City, 
California, had developed, marketed and supported software that enables 
customers to easily and quickly implement business applications on the 
Internet/World Wide Web, intranets and enterprise-wide client/server networks.
The total purchase price was $425 million, as adjusted, and was comprised of
cash payments of $319 million and the issuance of 1.5 million shares of the 
Company's common stock to the NeXT shareholders valued at approximately $25 
million according to the terms of the purchase agreement; the issuance of 
approximately 1.8 million options to purchase the Company's common stock to the
NeXT optionholders valued at approximately $16 million based on the difference
between the exercise price of the options and the market value of the Company's
stock on the date the options were granted; cash payments of $56 million to the 
NeXT debtholders; and cash payments of $9 million for closing and related 
costs, as adjusted. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and, 
accordingly, the operating results pertaining to NeXT subsequent to the date
of acquisition have been included in the Company's consolidated operating 
results. The purchase price, including the fair value of the net tangible 
liabilities assumed, was $427 million, as adjusted, of which $375 million was
allocated to purchased in-process research and development and $52 million 
was allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. The purchased in-process
research and development was charged to operations upon acquisition, and the
goodwill and other intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line 
basis over 2 to 7 years. The purchase price allocation is based on preliminary
estimates of the fair value of the acquired net assets and in-process research
and development and may be subject to adjustment as management completes its 
evaluation of the technology acquired and additional information becomes 
available during 1997.

The following unaudited proforma summary combines the consolidated results of
operations of the Company and NeXT as if the acquisition had occurred at the
beginning of the nine months ended June 27, 1997 and June 28, 1996, after 
giving effect to certain adjustments, including in-process research and 
development, amortization of intangible assets, lower interest income as a 
result of lower cash investment balances, and lower interest expense as a 
resultof the settlement of the NeXT debt, and related income tax effects. The 
proforma summary does not necessarily reflect the results of operations as they
would have been had the Company and NeXT been combined as of the beginning of 
such periods.

4.	In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings Per Share" 
("FAS 128"). Under the provisions of FAS 128, primary earnings per share will
be replaced with basic earnings per share, and fully diluted earnings per 
share will be replaced with diluted earnings per share for companies with 
potentially dilutive securities such as outstanding options and convertible 
debt. FAS 128 is effective for annual and interim periods ending after December
15, 1997 and will require restatement of all comparative per share amounts. 
The basic loss per share will be no different than the primary loss per share
as presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as 
neither consider outstanding options or convertible debt. If and when the 
Company becomes profitable, it will be required to present both basic and 
diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share, which does not consider 
potentially dilutive securities, will be greater than the replaced primary 
earnings per share which did consider those securities. Diluted earnings per 
share will not differ materially from the replaced fully diluted earnings per 
share. 	

5.	In July of 1997, the Board of Directors adopted a resolution allowing
employees to exchange all (but not less than all) of their existing options 
(vested and unvested) to purchase Apple common stock (other than options 
granted by and assumed from NeXT Software, Inc.) for options having an 
exercise price of $13.25 and a new three year vesting period beginning in July 
of 1997.

6.	The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed federal income tax
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made certain
prepayments thereon. The Company contested the proposed deficiencies by filing
petitions with the United States Tax Court, and most of the issues in dispute
have now  been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed income tax
adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. Although a substantial number of 
the issues for those years have been resolved, certain issues still remain in 
dispute and are being contested by the Company. Management believes that 
adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax 
examinations. 

7.	On August 6, 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft")
announced patent cross licensing and technology agreements between the two 
companies. In addition, Microsoft will purchase 150,000 shares of Apple Series
'A' Non-voting Convertible Preferred Stock ("Preferred Stock") for $150 
million.  Except under limited circumstances, the shares of Preferred Stock may
not be sold by Microsoft prior to August 5, 2000.  Upon any sale of the 
Preferred Stock by Microsoft, the shares will automatically be converted into 
shares of Apple common stock at a conversion price of $16.50 per share and the 
shares can be converted at Microsoft's option at such price after August 5, 
2000.  Each share of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive, if and when 
declared by the Company's Board of Directors, a dividend of $30 per share per 
annum, payable in preference to any dividend on the Company's common stock, 
plus, if the dividends per share paid on the common stock are greater than the
dividends pershare paid on the Preferred Stock on an as converted basis, then 
the Board of Directors shall declare an additional dividend such that the 
dividends per share paid on the Preferred Stock on an as converted basis, shall
equal the dividends per share paid on the common stock.

8.      In August 1997, the Board of Directors adopted a resolution to reserve
5 million shares for issuance under a new stock option plan for non-officer 
employees of the Company.

Overview

During the third quarter of 1997 the Company experienced modest 
increases in net sales, units shipped and estimated share of the 
personal computer market compared to the prior quarter. Despite 
these modest increases, results of all three quarters of 1997 showed 
significant declines in net sales, units shipped and the estimated 
share of the personal computer market compared to the same 
quarters of the prior year. In the third quarter the Company 
continued to effect supplemental restructuring actions it announced 
and began in the second quarter. The restructuring actions effected 
through the end of the third quarter have resulted in a decrease in 
operating expenses in that quarter compared to the prior quarter 
and the same quarter of the prior year. Although the Company 
believes that planned restructuring actions to be effected through 
the end of the fourth quarter will result in a decrease in operating 
expenses in that quarter compared to the prior quarter and the same 
quarter of the prior year, the Company does not believe it will return 
to profitability in the fourth quarter.


Net Sales

Q3 97 compared with Q3 96

Net sales decreased 20% in the third quarter of 1997 compared with 
the same quarter of 1996. Total Macintosh computer unit sales and 
peripheral unit sales decreased 17% and 27%, respectively, in the 
third quarter of 1997, compared with the same period of 1996, 
which the Company believes was due principally to customer 
concerns regarding the Company's strategic direction, financial 
condition, future prospects and the viability of the Macintosh 
platform, and to competitive pressures in the marketplace.  The 
average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit increased 8% in the 
third quarter of 1997 compared with the same period of 1996, as a 
result of a shift in mix toward the Company's newer 
and higher priced PowerBook(Registered Trademark) products, partially offset
by continued pricing actions, including rebates, across most product 
lines in an effort to stimulate demand. The average aggregate 
revenue per peripheral product decreased 25% in the third quarter 
of 1997 compared with the same period of 1996, as a result of a shift 
in mix toward certain lower priced products and continued 
pricing actions, including rebates, across most product lines in an 
effort to stimulate demand. The average aggregate revenue per 
Macintosh unit and per peripheral unit will remain under significant 
downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including 
industrywide pricing pressures, increased competition, and the need 
to stimulate demand for the Company's products.

International net sales represented 53% of total net sales in the third 
quarter of 1997 compared with 52% in the same period of 1996. 
International net sales declined 19% in the third quarter of 1997 
compared with the same period of 1996. Net sales in the European 
markets and in Japan decreased during the third quarter of 1997 
compared with the same period of 1996, as a result of 
decreases in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales and the average 
aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit, partially offset by an increase 
in the average aggregate revenue per peripheral unit in Japan.

Domestic net sales declined 22% in the third quarter of 1997, over 
the comparable period of 1996, due to decreases in unit sales of 
Macintosh computers and peripheral products and in the average 
aggregate revenue per peripheral unit, partially offset by an increase 
in the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit.

During the third quarter of 1997 compared with the comparable 
period of 1996, the Company's estimated share of the worldwide and 
U.S. personal computer markets declined to 3.7% from 5.1%, as 
adjusted, and to 4.6% from 6.5%, as adjusted, respectively, based 
upon market information provided by industry sources. In addition, 
the Company believes that its licensees' share of the worldwide 
personal computer market during such period increased to 
approximately 0.4% from approximately 0.1%.

Nine Months Ended June 27, 1997 compared with Nine Months Ended 
June 28, 1996

Net sales decreased 27% in the first nine months of 1997 compared 
with the same period of 1996. Total Macintosh computer unit sales 
and peripheral unit sales decreased 27% and 33%, respectively, in the 
first nine months of 1997, compared with the same period of 1996, 
as a result of a decline in worldwide demand for most product 
families, which the Company believes was due principally to 
customer concerns regarding the Company's strategic direction, 
financial condition, future prospects and the viability of the 
Macintosh platform, and to competitive pressures in the marketplace. 
In addition,Macintosh unit sales were negatively affected primarily 
during the first six months of 1997 as a result of the Company's 
inability to fulfill all purchase orders of Power Macintosh products 
due to the unavailability of sufficient quantities of certain 
components and product transition constraints. The average 
aggregate revenue per Macintosh and peripheral unit increased 
slightly in the first nine months of 1997 compared with the same 
period of 1996, primarily due to a shift in mix toward the Company's 
newer and higher priced PowerBook products, substantially offset by 
continued pricing actions, including rebates, across most product 
lines in an effort to stimulate demand. 

International net sales represented 53% of total net sales in the first 
nine months of 1997 and of 1996. International net sales declined 
28% in the first nine months of 1997 compared with the same period 
of 1996. Net sales in European markets and Japan decreased during 
the first nine months of 1997 compared with the same period in 
1996, as a result of decreases in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales 
and the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit, partially 
offset by an increase in the average aggregate revenue per 
peripheral unit.  

Domestic net sales declined 27% in the first nine months of 1997, 
over the comparable period of 1996, due to decreases in unit sales of 
Macintosh computers and peripheral products and the average 
aggregate revenue per peripheral unit, slightly offset by an increase 
in the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit.

Q3 97 compared with Q2 97 

Net sales increased 8% in the third quarter of 1997 compared with 
the second quarter of 1997. Total Macintosh computer unit sales 
increased 16% in the third quarter of 1997 compared with the prior 
quarter primarily as a result of the Company satisfying pent-up 
demand for certain of its "Flagship" line of higher-end Power 
Macintosh products by resolving certain product transition and 
component constraint issues which existed in the second quarter, 
partially offset by an easing of pent-up demand for new PowerBook 
products which were introduced in the second quarter. Unit sales of 
peripheral products increased slightly in the third quarter of 1997 
compared with the second quarter of 1997. The average aggregate 
revenue per Macintosh and peripheral unit decreased slightly in the 
third quarter of 1997 compared with the second quarter of 1997, 
primarily due to continued pricing actions, including rebates, 
across most product lines in an effort to stimulate demand and a 
shift in product mix away from the Company's higher priced 
PowerBook products, substantially offset by a shift in product mix 
toward the Company's newer and higher priced "Flagship" line of 
Power Macintosh products. 

International net sales represented 53% of total net sales in the third 
quarter of 1997, compared with 49% in the second quarter of 1997. 
International net sales increased 18% in the third quarter compared 
with the second quarter of 1997, primarily as a result of an increase 
in net sales in Japan due to increases in Macintosh unit sales and the 
average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit, slightly offset by 
decreases in peripheral unit sales and the average aggregate revenue 
per peripheral unit. The net sales increase in Japan was slightly 
offset by a decrease in the European markets. 

  				10
<PAGE> 
Domestic net sales declined slightly in the third quarter of 1997 
compared with the prior quarter, due to a decrease in the average 
aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit, substantially offset by 
increases in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales and the average 
aggregate revenue per peripheral unit.

During the third quarter of 1997 compared with the second quarter 
of 1997, the Company's estimated share of the worldwide and U.S. 
personal computer markets increased to 3.7% from 3.2%, as adjusted, 
and to 4.6% from 4.2%, as adjusted, respectively, based upon market 
information provided by industry sources. In addition, the Company 
believes that its licensees' share of the worldwide personal computer 
market during such period increased to approximately 0.4% from 
approximately 0.3%.

In general, the Company's resellers purchase products on an as-
needed basis. Resellers frequently change delivery schedules and 
order rates depending on changing market conditions. Unfilled orders 
("backlog") can be, and often are, canceled at will. The Company 
attempts to fill orders on the requested delivery schedules. The 
Company's backlog decreased to approximately $293 million at 
August 1, 1997, from approximately $409 million at May 2, 1997, 
primarily due to satisfying pent-up demand for the Company's 
"Flagship" line of Power Macintosh products as discussed above.

In the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog 
at any particular time is not necessarily a meaningful indication of its 
future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in 
anticipation of or immediately following introduction of new 
products because of over-ordering by dealers anticipating shortages. 
Backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers believe they can 
obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, as well as other 
factors affecting the Company's backlog, backlog should not be 
considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to achieve 
any particular level of revenue or financial performance. 

The Company believes that net sales will be below the level of the 
prior year's comparable periods through at least the first quarter of 
1998, if not longer.


Gross Margin

Gross margin represents the difference between the Company's net 
sales and its cost of goods sold. The amount of revenue generated by 
the sale of products is influenced principally by the price set by the 
Company for its products relative to competitive products. The cost 
of goods sold is based primarily on the cost of components and, to a 
lesser extent, direct labor costs. The type and cost of components 
included in particular configurations of the Company's products (such 
as memory and disk drives) are often directly related to the 
need to market products in configurations competitive with other 
manufacturers. Competition in the personal computer industry is 
intense and, in the short term, frequent changes in pricing and 
product configuration are often necessary in order to remain 
competitive. Accordingly, gross margin as a percentage of net sales 
can be significantly influenced in the short term by actions 
undertaken by the Company in response to industrywide competitive 
pressures.

Gross margin increased from 18.5% to 20.0% of sales during 
the third quarter of 1997 compared to the same period of 1996, 
primarily as a result of an increase in the gross margin 
percentage on the sale of the Company's PowerBook products 
and a shift in mix towards these products which yield a high 
gross margin per unit, as well as an increase in the gross 
margin percentage on the sale of the Company's "Value" line 
of Power Macintosh products (formerly generally referred to 
as entry level and  Performa(Registered Trademark) products).

Gross margin increased from 6.1% to 19.2% of sales during the first 
nine months of 1997 compared to the same period of 1996, primarily 
as a result of a $616 million charge in the second quarter of 1996
	
				11
<PAGE> 

that related principally to the write-down of certain inventory, as 
well as to the cost to cancel excess component orders necessitated by 
significantly lower than expected demand for many of the Company's products,
primarily its "Value" line of Power Macintosh products. Also, the Company 
separately incurred a $60 million charge in the second quarter of 1996 to 
reflect the estimated cost to correct certain quality problems in certain of 
the "Value" line of Power Macintosh products, as well as PowerBook products. 
In addition, gross margins in the second quarter of 1996, and to a lesser 
degree the first quarter of that year, were adversely affected by aggressive
pricing actions in Japan in response to extreme competitive actions by other
companies, as well as pricing actions in the U.S. and Europe across all 
product lines in order to stimulate demand.

Gross margin increased from 18.9% to 20.0% of sales during the third 
quarter of 1997 compared with the second quarter of 1997, 
primarily as a result of an increase in the gross margin percentage on 
the sale of the Company's "Flagship" line of Power Macintosh 
products and a shift in mix towards these products which yield a 
high gross margin per unit, as well as an increase in the gross margin 
percentage on the sale of the Company's "Value" line of Power 
Macintosh products, offset in part by a reduced mix in PowerBook 
products.

The gross margin levels in the third quarter of 1997 compared with 
the second quarter of 1997 and the third quarter of 1996, and in the 
first nine months of 1997 compared with the corresponding period of 
1996, were also adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative 
to certain foreign currencies. This negative impact was offset by 
hedging gains. The Company's operating strategy and pricing take 
into account changes in exchange rates over time; however, the 
Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in 
the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 

There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to sustain 
the gross margin levels achieved in the third quarter and in the first 
nine months of 1997. Gross margins will remain under significant 
downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued 
industrywide pricing pressures around the world, increased 
competition, and compressed product life cycles. In response to those 
downward pressures, the Company expects it will continue to 
take pricing actions with respect to its products. Gross margins could 
also be affected by the Company's ability to effectively manage 
quality problems and warranty costs, and to stimulate demand for 
certain of its products.

Research and development expenditures decreased in amount in the 
third quarter of 1997 compared with the second quarter of 1997 and 
the third quarter of 1996, and during the first nine months of 1997 
compared with the same period of 1996. The decreases are primarily 
due to certain restructuring actions initiated by the Company late in 
the second quarter of 1997. Research and development expenditures 
also decreased as a percentage of sales in the third quarter of 1997 
compared with the second quarter of 1997 and the third quarter of 
1996, primarily due to the impact of such restructuring actions, 
partially offset by a decrease in the level of net sales. The increase as 
a percentage of net sales for the first nine months of 1997 compared 
with the same period of 1996 resulted from a decrease in the level of 
net sales, partially offset by the impact of such restructuring actions.

The Company believes that continued investments in research and 
development are critical to its future growth and competitive 
position in the marketplace and are directly related to continued, 
timely development of new and enhanced products that are central 
to the Company's core business strategy. The Company believes its 
research and development expenditures will decrease slightly in the 
fourth quarter of 1997 compared with the third quarter of 1997 as 
the Company completes and more fully realizes the cost reduction 
benefits of its restructuring plan. For additional information 
regarding the restructuring plan, refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the

to the impact of such restructuring actions partially offset by a 
decrease in the level of net sales.  The increase as a percentage of net 
sales for the first nine months 1997 compared with the same period 
of 1996 resulted from a decrease in the level of net sales, partially 
offset by the impact of such restructuring actions.

The Company believes its selling, general and administrative 
expenditures will continue to decrease in the fourth quarter of 1997 
compared with the third quarter of 1997, as the Company completes 
and more fully realizes the cost reduction benefits of its 
restructuring plan, slightly offset by the amortization 
expense on the intangible assets the Company recognized as a result 
of the acquisition of NeXT. For additional information regarding the 
Company's restructuring actions and the acquisition of NeXT, refer to 
Notes 2 and 3, respectively, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements (Unaudited) in Part I, Item I, and to Factors That May 
Affect Future Results and Financial Condition as well as Liquidity and

10-Q, which information is hereby incorporated by reference.

Interest and other income, net, decreased in the third quarter of 
1997 and for the first nine months of 1997 compared with the same 
periods of 1996, primarily due to  $69 million of realized gains on 
sales of available-for-sale securities realized in the third quarter of 
1996. Interest and other income, net, decreased in the third quarter 
of 1997 compared with the second quarter of 1997 as a result of 
lower average cash balances, due to cash used to acquire NeXT, to 
fund the restructuring actions begun in the second quarter of 1997 
and to fund operations. The Company expects interest income to be flat in 
the fourth quarter of 1997 compared with the immediate prior quarter.

At June 27, 1997, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from 
deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $591 
million before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for 
presentation on the Company's balance sheet. A substantial portion 
of this asset is realizable based on the ability to offset existing 
deferred tax liabilities. In the first nine months of 1997, a valuation 
allowance of $174 million was recorded against the deferred tax 
asset for the benefits of tax losses which may not be realized. 
Realization of approximately $85 million of the asset is dependent on 
the Company's ability to generate approximately $245 million of 
future U.S. taxable income. Management believes that it is more 
likely than not that the asset will be realized based on forecasted U.S. 
income. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will 
meet its expectations of future U.S. income. As a result, the amount of 
the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the 
near and long term if estimates of future taxable U.S. income 
are reduced. Such an occurrence could materially adversely affect 
the Company's financial results. The Company will continue to 
evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by 
assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance.

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition

Overview

The Company's future operating results and financial condition 
are dependent upon the Company's ability to successfully develop, 
manufacture, and market technologically innovative products in 
order to meet dynamic customer demand patterns, and its ability to 
effect a change in marketplace perception of the Company's 
prospects, including the viability of the Macintosh platform. 
Inherent in this process are a number of factors that the 
Company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable 
future operating results and a favorable financial condition. 
Potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company's 
future operating results and financial condition include, without 
limitation, continued competitive pressures in the marketplace 
and the effect of any reaction by the Company to such competitive 
pressures, including pricing actions by the Company; the 
availability of key components on terms acceptable to the 
Company; the Company's ability to supply products in certain 
categories; the Company's ability to supply products free of latent 
defects or other faults; the Company's ability to make timely 
delivery to the marketplace of technological innovations, 
including its ability to continue to make timely delivery of 
planned enhancements to the current Macintosh operating 
system ("Mac(Registered Trademark) OS") and to make timely delivery of a 
new and substantially backward-compatible OS; the Company's ability to 
successfully integrate NeXT technologies, processes and employees 
with those at Apple; the Company's ability to successfully 
implement its strategic direction and restructuring actions, 
including reducing its expenditures; the Company's ability to 
attract, motivate and retain employees, including a new Chief 
Executive Officer; the effects of significant adverse publicity; and 
the availability of third-party software for particular 
applications.

The Company expects that it will not return to profitability in the 
fourth quarter of 1997.

Restructuring of Operations and  New Business Model

During 1996, the Company began to implement certain 
restructuring actions aimed at reducing its cost structure, 
improving its competitiveness, and restoring sustained 
profitability. In the second quarter of 1997, the Company 
announced and began to implement supplemental restructuring 
actions, including significant headcount reductions, to meet the 
foregoing objectives. There are several risks inherent in the 
Company's efforts to transition to a new cost structure. These 
include the risk that the Company will not be able to reduce 
expenditures quickly enough to restore sustained profitability 
and the risk that cost-cutting initiatives will impair the 
Company's ability to innovate and remain competitive in the 
computer industry.  

As part of its restructuring effort, the Company has been 
implementing a new business model. Implementation of the new 
business model involves several risks, including the risk that by 
simplifying and modifying its product line the Company will 
increase its dependence on fewer products, potentially reduce 
overall sales, and increase its reliance on unproven products and 
technology. Another risk of the new business model is that by 
increasing the proportion of the Company's products to be 
manufactured under outsourcing arrangements, the Company 
could lose control of the quality or quantity of the products 
manufactured, or lose the flexibility to make timely changes in 
production schedules in order to respond to changing market 
conditions. In addition, the new business model could adversely 
affect employee morale, thereby damaging the Company's ability 
to retain and motivate employees. Also, because the new business 
model contemplates that the Company will rely to a greater extent 
on collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, 
the Company will have less direct control over certain of its 
research and development efforts, and its ability to create 
innovative new products may be reduced. In addition, the new 
business model now includes the acquisition of NeXT. There can 
be no assurance that the technologies acquired from NeXT will be 
successfully exploited, or that key NeXT employees and processes 
will be retained and successfully integrated with those at Apple. 
Also, the new business model now includes the "spin-out" of the 
Company's Newton(Registered Trademark) unit into a 

				18
<PAGE> 

separate but wholly-owned subsidiary named Newton, Inc. There 
can be no assurance that Newton, Inc. will be successful as a 
separate entity. Finally, even if the new business model is 
successfully implemented, there can be no assurance that it will 
effectively resolve the various issues currently facing the 
Company. Although the Company believes that the actions it is 
taking and will take under its new business model, including its 
restructuring plan, its acquisition of NeXT, and its "spin-out" of 
Newton, Inc., should help restore marketplace confidence in the 
Company, there can be no assurance that such actions will enable 
the Company to achieve its objectives of reducing its cost 
structure, improving its competitiveness, and restoring sustained 
profitability. The Company's future operating results and 
financial condition could be adversely affected should it 
encounter difficulty in effectively managing the transition to 
the new business model and cost structure.

For information regarding the Company's restructuring actions 
and the acquisition of NeXT, refer to Notes 2 and 3, respectively, of 
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) in 
Part I, Item I, and to Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part I, 
Item II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which information 
is hereby incorporated by reference.

Product  Introductions and Transitions 

Due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer 
industry, which is characterized by dynamic customer demand 
patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company 
frequently introduces new products and product enhancements, 
including the recent introductions of certain PowerBook and 
Power Macintosh products, and the introduction of Mac OS 8 in 
July of 1997. The success of new product introductions is 
dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance, 
the Company's ability to manage the risks associated with product 
transitions, the availability of application software for new 
products, the effective management of inventory levels in line 
with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in 
appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand, and the risk 
that new products may have quality or other defects in the early 
stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot 
determine the ultimate effect that new products will have on its 
sales or results of operations. In addition, although the number of 
new product introductions may decrease under the Company's 
new business model, the risks and uncertainties associated with 
new product introductions may increase as the Company 
refocuses its product offerings on key growth segments and to 
the extent new product introductions are in markets that are new 
to the Company.

The rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of a new
product is not necessarily an indication of the future rate of shipments for
that product, which depends on many factors, some of which are not under the
control of the Company. These factors may include initial large purchases by a 
small segment of the user population that tends to purchase new technology 
prior to its acceptance by the majority of users ("early adopters"); purchases
in satisfaction of pent-up demand by users who anticipated new technology 
and, as a result, deferred purchases of other products; and overordering by 
dealers who anticipate shortages due to the aforementioned factors. These 
factors may be offset by others, such as the deferral of purchases by many 
users until new technology is accepted as "proven" and for which commonly 
used software products are available; and the reduction of orders by dealers 
once they believe they can obtain sufficient supply of products previously in
backlog. 

Backlog is often volatile after new product introductions due to the 
aforementioned demand factors, often increasing coincident with introduction,
and then decreasing once dealers and customers believe they can obtain 
sufficient supply of the new products. 

The measurement of demand for newly introduced products is further complicated
by the availability of different product configurations, which may include 
various types of built-in peripherals and software. Configurations may also 
require certain localization (such as language) for various markets and, as 
a result, demand in different geographic areas may be a function of the 
availability of third-party software in those localized versions. For example, 
the availability of European-language versions of software products 
				19
<PAGE> 
manufactured by U.S. producers may lag behind the availability of U.S. versions 
by a quarter or more. This may result in lower initial demand for the 
Company's new products outside the United States, even though localized 
versions of the Company's products may be available.

The increasing integration of functions and complexity of 
operations of the Company's products also increase the risk that 
latent defects or other faults could be discovered by customers or 
end-users after volumes of products have been produced or 
shipped. If such defects were significant, the Company could 
incur material recall and replacement costs under product 
warranties.

The Company has announced plans for two operating systems. 
The Company plans to continue to introduce major upgrades to 
the current Mac OS and later introduce a new OS (code named 
"Rhapsody") which is expected to offer advanced functionality 
based on Apple and NeXT software technologies. However, the 
NeXT software technologies that the Company plans to use in the 
development of Rhapsody were not originally designed to be 
compatible with the Mac OS. As a result, there can be no 
assurance that the development of Rhapsody will be successful. 
In addition, Rhapsody may not be fully backward-compatible 
with all existing applications, which could result in a loss of 
existing customers. Finally, it is uncertain whether Rhapsody or 
the planned enhancements to the current Mac OS will gain 
developer support and market acceptance. Inability to 
successfully develop and make timely delivery of a substantially 
backward-compatible Rhapsody or of planned enhancements to 
the current Mac OS, or to gain developer support and market 
acceptance for those operating systems, may have an adverse 
impact on the Company's operating results and financial 
condition.
  
Competition

The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is 
characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward 
pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new 
products, short product life cycles, continual improvement in 
product price/performance characteristics, price sensitivity on 
the part of consumers, and a large number of competitors. The 
Company's results of operations and financial condition have 
been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by 
industrywide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross 
margins. The industry has also been characterized by rapid 
technological advances in software functionality and hardware 
performance and features based on existing or emerging 
industry standards. Many of the Company's competitors have 
greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological 
resources, broader product lines and larger installed customer 
bases than those of the Company.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition 
may be affected by overall demand for personal computers and 
general customer preferences for one platform over another or 
one set of product features over another.

The Company is currently the primary maker of hardware that 
uses the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the 
personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of 
computers that run the MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows operating 
systems. The Company believes that the Mac OS, with its perceived 
advantages over MS-DOS and Windows, has been a driving force 
behind sales of the Company's personal computer hardware for 
the past several years. Recent innovations in the Windows 
platform, including those included in Windows 95 and Windows 
NT, or those expected to be included in Windows 98, have added 
features to the Windows platform which make the differences 
between the Mac OS and Microsoft's Windows operating systems less 
significant.  The Company is currently taking and will continue 
to take steps to respond to the competitive pressures being placed 
on its personal computer sales as a result of the recent 
innovations in the Windows platform. The Company's future 
operating results and financial condition may be affected by its 
ability to maintain and increase the installed base for the 
Macintosh platform.  


			20
<PAGE> 

As part of its efforts to increase the installed base for the 
Macintosh platform, the Company announced the licensing of the 
Mac OS to other personal computer vendors in 1995 and 1996. 
Several vendors currently sell products that utilize the Macintosh 
operating system, many of which have licensing arrangements 
with the Company. As a result of licensing its operating system, 
the Company competes with other companies producing Mac OS-
based computer systems. The benefits to the Company from 
licensing the Mac OS to third parties may be more than offset by 
the disadvantages of competing with them. The Company is 
currently in discussions concerning the nature of such licensing 
arrangements going forward, including whether or not to extend 
such arrangements. There can be no assurance that the 
Company's Mac OS licensing strategy will prove successful or will 
financially benefit the Company or, if the Company decides to 
alter its strategy, that it will be able to modify its existing 
licensing arrangements to pursue such a strategy. 

As a supplemental means of addressing the competition from MS-
DOS and Windows, the Company has devoted substantial resources 
toward developing personal computer products capable of 
running application software designed for the MS-DOS or 
Windows operating systems ("Cross-Platform Products"). These 
products include the RISC-based PowerPC(TradeMark) microprocessor and 
either include the Pentium or 586-class microprocessor or can 
accommodate an add-on card containing a Pentium or 586-class 
microprocessor. These products enable users to run concurrently 
applications that require the Mac OS, MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, or 
Windows 95 operating systems. The Company has supplied 
customers who purchase Cross-Platform Products with Windows 
operating system software under licensing agreements with 
certain Microsoft distributors.  The Company's ability to market 
Cross-Platform Products could be adversely affected if such 
Microsoft distributors were unwilling to continue to supply the 
Company with Windows operating system software on the terms 
of such licensing agreements.  

The Company, International Business Machines Corporation 
("IBM") and Motorola, Inc. ("Motorola") have agreed upon and announced 
the availability of specifications for a PowerPC microprocessor-based 
hardware reference platform. These specifications define a 
"unified" personal computer architecture that gives access to 
both the Power Macintosh platform and the PC environment and 
utilizes standard industry components. The Company's future 
operating results and financial condition may be affected by its 
ability to continue to implement this agreement and to manage 
the risk associated with the transition to this new hardware 
reference platform. Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") recently announced 
that it would no longer adapt its Windows NT operating system software, 
which is being used more by corporations, to run on the PowerPC 
microprocessor. This decision may adversely affect revenues 
derived from this new hardware reference platform.

Several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their 
intention to target certain of the Company's key market segments, including 
education and publishing. Many of these companies have greater financial, 
marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources than the Company.

On August 6, 1997, the Company and Microsoft announced patent cross licensing
and technology agreements between the two companies. Under these agreements, 
the companies provided patent cross licenses to each other.  In addition, 
Microsoft will make future versions of its Microsoft Office and Internet 
Explorer products for the Mac OS, and the Company will bundle the Internet 
Explorer product with Mac OS system software releases and make that product 
the default internet browser for such releases. The Company also announced 
that Microsoft will purchase 150,000 shares of Apple Series 'A' Non-voting 
Convertible Preferred Stock for $150 million. While the Company believes that
its relationship with Microsoft will be beneficial to the Company and to its
efforts to increase the installed base for the Mac OS, the Microsoft 
relationship is for a limited term and does not cover many of the 
areas in which the Company competes with Microsoft, including 
the Windows platform. In addition, the Microsoft relationship 
may have an adverse effect on, but not limited to, the Company's 
relationship with other partners. There can be no assurance that 
the benefits to the Company of the Microsoft relationship will not 
be offset by the disadvantages.

				21

Support from Third-Party Software Developers

Decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers, as 
opposed to MS-DOS or Windows-based systems, are often based on the 
availability of third-party software for particular applications. The Company
believes that the availability of third-party application software for the 
Company's hardware products depends in part on third-party developers' 
perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, 
maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company's products versus 
software for the larger MS-DOS and Windows market. This analysis is based on
factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the 
anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, and the costs of 
developing such software products. To the extent the Company's recent 
financial losses and declining demand for the Company's product have caused 
software developers to question the Company's prospects in the personal 
computer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new application 
software or upgrade existing software for the Company's products and more 
inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for 
the larger MS-DOS and Windows market. Microsoft is an important developer of
application software for the Company's products. Although the Company has 
entered into a relationship with Microsoft, which includes Microsoft's 
agreement to develop and ship future versions of its Microsoft Office and 
Internet Explorer products and certain other Microsoft tools for the Mac OS, 
such relationship is for a limited term and does not cover many areas in which 
theCompany competes with Microsoft. Accordingly, Microsoft's interest in 
producingapplication software for the Company's products not covered by the 
relationship or upon expiration of the relationship may be influenced by 
Microsoft's perception of its interests as the vendor of the Windows 
operating system.

Global Market Risks 

A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its 
international operations. As a result, the Company's operations 
and financial results could be significantly affected by risks 
associated with international activities, including economic and 
labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. 
taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the 
United States dollar versus the local currency in which the 
products are sold.  When the U.S. dollar strengthens against other 
currencies, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales 
decreases. When the U.S. dollar weakens, the U.S. dollar value of 
non-U.S. dollar-based sales increases. Correspondingly, the U.S. 
dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based costs increases when the 
U.S. dollar weakens and decreases when the U.S. dollar 
strengthens. Overall, the Company is a net receiver of currencies 
other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker 
dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to 
major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in exchange 
rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may 
negatively affect the Company's consolidated sales and gross 
margins (as expressed in U.S. dollars). 

To mitigate the short-term impact of fluctuating currency 
exchange rates on the Company's non-U.S. dollar-based sales, 
product procurement, and operating expenses, the Company 
regularly hedges its non-U.S. dollar-based exposures. 
Specifically, the Company enters into foreign exchange forward 
and option contracts to hedge its assets, liabilities and firmly 
committed transactions. Currently, hedges of firmly committed 
transactions do not extend beyond one year. The Company also 
purchases foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain 
other probable but not firmly committed transactions. Hedges of 
probable but not firmly committed transactions currently do not 
extend beyond one year. To reduce the costs associated with these 
ongoing foreign exchange hedging programs, the Company also 
regularly sells foreign exchange option contracts and enters into 
certain other foreign exchange transactions. All foreign 
exchange forward and option contracts not accounted for as 
hedges, including all transactions intended to reduce the costs 
associated with the Company's foreign exchange hedging 
programs, are carried at fair value and are adjusted on each 
balance sheet date for changes in exchange rates.  

While the Company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in the 
interest rates of many of the world's leading industrialized 
countries, the Company's interest income and expense is most 
			22
<PAGE> 

sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. 
In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest 
earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term 
investments as well as interest paid on its notes payable to banks 
and long-term debt. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in U.S. 
interest rates, the Company has entered into interest rate swap, 
collar, and floor transactions. Certain of these transactions are 
intended to better match the Company's floating-rate interest 
income on its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments 
with the fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt. The 
Company also enters into these transactions in order to diversify 
a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in 
short-term U.S. interest rates. These instruments may extend the 
Company's cash investment horizon up to a maximum duration of 
three years.

To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's 
foreign exchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to 
monitor the risks and opportunities of the nonhedge portfolios, 
the Company continually monitors its foreign exchange forward 
and option positions, and its interest rate swap, option and floor 
positions both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its 
underlying foreign currency- and interest rate-related 
exposures, respectively, from both an accounting and an 
economic perspective. However, given the effective horizons of 
the Company's risk management activities, there can be no 
assurance that the aforementioned programs will offset more 
than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from 
unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest 
rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of 
gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any 
given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses 
related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, 
may adversely affect the Company's operating results and 
financial position. The Company generally does not engage in 
leveraged hedging. 

The Company's current financial condition is expected to 
increase the costs of its hedging transactions, as well as affect the 
nature of the hedging transactions into which the Company's 
counterparties are willing to enter.

Inventory and Supply

The Company provides reserves against any inventories of 
products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated 
demand, accrues for any cancellation fees of orders for 
inventories that have been canceled, and accrues for the 
estimated costs to correct any product quality problems.  
Although the Company believes its inventory and related 
reserves are adequate, no assurance can be given that the 
Company will not incur additional inventory and related charges. 
In addition, such charges have had, and may again have, a 
material effect on the Company's financial position and results of 
operations.

The Company must order components for its products and build 
inventory well in advance of product shipments. Because the 
Company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology 
and price changes, there is a risk that the Company will forecast 
incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of 
particular products. The Company's operating results and 
financial condition have been in the past and may in the future 
be materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to 
manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in 
customer demand patterns.  

Certain of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or 
in part by third-party manufacturers, either pursuant to design 
specifications of the Company or otherwise. As part of its 
restructuring actions, the Company has sold its Fountain, Colorado, 
manufacturing facility to SCI Systems, Inc. ("SCI") and entered into a 
related manufacturing outsourcing agreement with SCI; sold its Singapore 
printed circuit board manufacturing assets to NatSteel Electronics Pte., Ltd. 
who will then supply main logic boards to the Company under a manufacturing 
outsourcing agreement; entered into an agreement with Ryder Integrated 
Logistics, Inc. to outsource the Company's domestic operations transportation 
and logistics management, and has entered into other similar 
			23
<PAGE> 

agreements to outsource the Company's European operations transportation and 
logistics management. As a result of the foregoing actions, the proportion of 
the Company's products produced and distributed under outsourcing arrangements
will continue to increase. While outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed
cost of operations, they will also reduce the direct control the Company has 
over production. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have 
on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured, or the flexibility of 
the Company to respond to changing market conditions. Furthermore, any efforts 
by the Company to manage its inventory under outsourcing arrangements could 
subject the Company to liquidated damages or cancellation of the arrangement.
Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions 
for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company remains at least initially 
responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service. Accordingly, in 
the event of product defects or warranty liability, the Company may remain 
primarily liable. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, 
whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, 
could adversely affect the Company's future operating results and financial 
condition.

Although certain raw materials, processes and components essential to the 
Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, other 
processes and key components (including microprocessors and application 
specific integrated circuits ("ASICs") ) are currently obtained by the 
Company from single sources. If the supply of a key single-sourced material,
process or component were to be delayed or curtailed, the Company's business
and financial performance could be adversely affected, depending on the time 
required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to 
identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternate source. The 
Company believes that the availability from suppliers to the personal computer
industry of microprocessors and ASICs presents the most significant potential
for constraining the Company's ability to manufacture products. Some advanced
microprocessors are currently in the early stages of ramp-up for production 
and thus have limited availability. The Company and other producers in the 
personal computer industry also compete for other semiconductor products 
with other industries that have experienced increased demand for such products,
due to either increased consumer demand or increased use of semiconductors 
in their products (such as the cellular phone and automotive industries). 
Finally, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of 
the personal computer industry (including certain microprocessors 
and ASICs). Continued availability of these components may be affected if 
producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components
instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. Such 
product supply constraints and corresponding increased costs could decrease 
the Company's net sales and adversely affect the Company's operating results
and financial condition.

The Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also 
dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Motorola, the suppliers
of the PowerPC RISC microprocessor for certain of the Company's products, to
supply to the Company in adequate numbers microprocessors that produce 
superior price/performance results compared with those supplied to the 
Company's competitors by Intel Corporation, the developer and producer of the
microprocessors used by most personal computers using the MS-DOS and Windows
operating systems. In addition, the desire of IBM and Motorola to continue 
producing these microprocessors may be influenced by Microsoft's decision 
not to adapt its Windows NT operating system software to run on the PowerPC 
microprocessor. IBM produces personal computers based on Intel microprocessors
as well as workstations based on the PowerPC microprocessor, and is also the
developer of OS/2, a competing operating system to the Company's Mac OS. 
Accordingly, IBM's interest in supplying the Company with microprocessors for
the Company's products may be influenced by IBM's perception of its interests
as a competing manufacturer of personal computers and as a competing operating
system vendor.

The Company's current financial condition and uncertainties related to recent
events could effect the terms on which suppliers are willing to supply the 
Company with their products.  There can be no assurance that the Company's 
current suppliers will continue to supply the Company on terms acceptable to 
the Company or that the Company will be able to obtain comparable products 
from alternate sources on such terms.  The Company's future operating results 
and financial condition could be adversely affected if the Company is unable 
				24
<PAGE> 

to continue to obtain key components on terms substantially similar to those 
currently available to the Company.

Marketing and Distribution

A number of uncertainties may affect the marketing and distribution of the 
Company's products. Currently, the Company's primary means of distribution 
is through third-party computer resellers. Such resellers include consumer 
channels such as mass-merchandise stores, consumer electronics outlets, and 
computer superstores. The Company's business and financial results could be 
adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakened or
if resellers within consumer channels were to decide not to continue to 
distribute the Company's products.

Uncertainty over demand for the Company's products may cause resellers to 
reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products. Under the 
Company's arrangements with its resellers, resellers have the option to 
reduce or eliminate unfilled orders previously placed, in most instances 
without financial penalty. Resellers also have the option to return products 
to the Company without penalty within certain limits, beyond which they may be
assessed fees. The Company has experienced a reduction in ordering from 
historical levels by resellers due to uncertainty concerning the Company's
condition and prospects.

Change in Senior Management

On July 9, 1997, the Company announced that Dr. Gilbert F. Amelio had resigned
his positions as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and that 
the Company was initiating a search for a new Chief Executive Officer.  While
the Company intends to name a new Chief Executive Officer as soon as 
practicable, there can be no assurance that the change in senior management 
and related uncertainties will not adversely affect the Company's operating 
results and financial condition during the period until a new Chief Executive 
Officer is hired and afterward.

Changes to Board of Directors

The Company announced on August 6, 1997 significant changes to its Board of 
Directors, replacing all but two former directors. The continuing directors 
are Gareth Chang and Edgar Woolard.  The new directors are William Campbell, 
President and CEO of Intuit Corp.; Lawrence Ellison, Chairman and CEO of 
Oracle Corp.; Steve Jobs, Chairman and CEO of Pixar Animation Studios; and 
Jerome York, former CFO of IBM and Chrysler Corporation. 

Other Factors

The majority of the Company's research and development activities, its 
corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations, including 
certain major vendors, are located near major seismic faults. The Company's 
operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely 
affected in the event of a major earthquake.

Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may 
subject the Company to environmental and other regulations which include, 
in some instances, the requirement that the Company provide consumers with 
the ability to return to the Company product at the end of its useful life, 
and leave responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with 
the Company. It is unclear what effect such regulation will have on the 
Company's future operating results and financial condition.

The Company recently evaluated replacing its existing transaction systems 
(which include order management, product procurement, distribution, and 
finance) with a single integrated system, but has decided to continue



				25
<PAGE> 

to use its existing transaction systems for the foreseeable future. The 
Company's future operating results and financial condition could be adversely
affected if the Company is unable to effectively manage its existing 
transaction systems.

Because of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting the 
Company's operating results and financial condition, past financial 
performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future 
performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate 
results or trends in future periods. In addition, the Company's participation 
in a highly dynamic industry often results in significant volatility of 
the Company's common stock price.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash 
equivalents, and short-term investments, net of notes payable to 
banks, decreased to $1,103 million at June 27, 1997, from $1,559 
million at September 27, 1996. The Company's financial position 
with respect to cash, cash equivalents, and short-term 
investments decreased to $1,230 million at June 27, 1997, from 
$1,745 million at September 27, 1996. The Company's cash and 
cash equivalent balance at June 27, 1997 and September 27, 1996, 
includes $176 million and $177 million, respectively, pledged as 
collateral to support letters of credit primarily associated with the 
Company's purchase commitments under the terms of the sale of 
the Company's Fountain, Colorado, manufacturing facility to SCI. 

Cash used by operations during the first nine months of 1997 
totaled $10 million, primarily due to the Company's net loss, 
adjusted for non-cash expenses such as in-process research and 
development, and a decrease in certain current liabilities, as well 
as restructuring costs, partially offset by a decrease in accounts 
receivable and inventories. The Company expects to use cash to 
fund operations over at least the next quarter.

Cash used to acquire NeXT totaled $384 million in the second 
quarter of 1997. The Company expects no additional cash 
expenditures related to the NeXT acquisition. Cash used for the 
purchase of property, plant, and equipment totaled $42 million in 
the first nine months of 1997, and consisted primarily of 
increases in manufacturing machinery and equipment. The 
Company expects that the level of capital expenditures for the 
remainder of 1997 will be comparable to the same period of 1996.

The Company's debt ratings remain unchanged from the second 
quarter of 1997, when the Company's senior and subordinated 
long-term debt were downgraded to B and CCC+, respectively, by 
Standard and Poor's Rating Agency and to B3 and Caa, 
respectively, by Moody's Investor Services. The Company was also 
placed on negative credit watch by Moody's Investor Services.  
These actions may increase the Company's cost of funds in future 
periods. In addition, the Company may be required to pledge 
additional collateral with respect to certain of its borrowings and 
letters of credit and to agree to more stringent covenants than in 
the past.

The Company believes that its balances of cash and cash 
equivalents and short-term investments, including proceeds from the August 
1997 sale of Apple Series A Non-voting Convertible Preferred Stock to 
Microsoft, and continued short-term borrowings from banks, will be sufficient 
to meet its cash requirements over the next 12 months. In addition to funding 
an expected net loss for at least the next quarter, expected cash requirements
over the next twelve months include an estimated $100 million to effect 
actions under the restructuring plan, most of which will be effected 
over the next six months. Also, the notes payable to banks all become due 
prior to September 30, 1997. No assurance can be given that short-term 
borrowings from banks can be continued, or that any additional required 
financing could be obtained should the restructuring plan take longer to 
implement than anticipated or be unsuccessful. If the Company is unable to 
obtain such financing, its liquidity, results of operations, and financial 
condition would be materially adversely affected. 

The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed federal 
income tax deficiencies for the years 
				26
<PAGE>

1984 through 1991, and the Company has made certain 
prepayments thereon. The Company contested the proposed 
deficiencies by filing  petitions with the United States Tax Court, 
and most of the issues in dispute have now  been resolved. On 
June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed income tax adjustments for the 
years 1992 through 1994. Although a substantial number of the 
issues for these years have been resolved, certain issues still 
remain in dispute and are being contested by the Company. 
Management believes that adequate provision has been made for 
any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

Reference is made to page 45 of the Company's 1996 Annual Report on Form 10-K 
under the subheading "Litigation" for a discussion of certain consumer class
actions relating to "repetitive stress injury" claims.

In July 1997, the Court in the case styled Abraham and Evelyn Kostick Trust 
v. Peter Crisp  et. al. granted in part and denied in part the Company's 
motion to strike most of the substantive allegations of the second amended 
complaint. The Court had previously sustained the demurrer to plaintiffs' 
class claims but overruled the demurrer to the shareholder derivative claims.
The Company intends to make additional motions to dispose of the case on the 
pleadings, including filing a demurrer to any amended complaint that plaintiffs
may elect to serve.

On July 8, 1997, the Court in the case styled LS Men's Clothing Defined 
Benefit Pension Fund v. Michael Spindler et. al. sustained the Company's 
demurrer dismissing the amended complaint with leave to amend. On July 28, 
1997, plaintiff served a second amended complaint.

In March 1997, the Court in the case styled In re Computer Monitor Litigation
preliminarily approved a proposed settlement to which the Company and all but 
three of the other defendants in the action would be parties and provisionally 
certified a nationwide settlement class with respect thereto. A hearing 
regarding final approval of the proposed settlement was held on June 30, 1997 
and the Court's decision is pending. If approved, the Company does not 
anticipate its obligations pursuant to the proposed settlement will have a 
material adverse effect on its financial condition as reported in the 
accompanying financial statements.

In June 1997, the Federal Trade Commission and the Company agreed to a consent
decree regarding the Company's past processor upgrade practices. The terms of
this decree would include an upgrade offer to customers and an agreement to 
some terms about future activities by the Company. The consent decree is 
pending court approval.

The Company has various other claims, lawsuits, disputes with third parties, 
investigations and pending actions involving allegations of false or 
misleading advertising, product defects, discrimination, infringement of 
intellectual property rights, and breach of contract and other matters against 
the Company  and its subsidiaries incident to the operation of its business. 
The liability, if any, associated with these matters was not determinable as
 of the date of this filing. 

The Company believes the resolution of the matters cited above will not have 
a material adverse effect on its financial condition as reported in the 
accompanying financial statements. However, depending on the amount and timing 
of any unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits, it is possible that the 
Company's future results of operations or cash flows could be materially 
affected in a particular period.

Retention Agreement


Dear Fred: 

		Apple Computer, Inc., a California corporation (the 
"Company"), considers it essential to the best interests of its 
stockholders to take reasonable steps to retain key management 
personnel.  Further, the Board of Directors of the Company (the 
"Board") recognizes that the uncertainty and questions which might 
arise among management in the context of a change in control of the 
Company could result in the departure or distraction of management 
personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders.  

		The Board has determined, therefore, that appropriate 
steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued 
attention and dedication of members of the management of the 
Company and its subsidiaries, including yourself, to their assigned 
duties without distraction in the face of potentially disturbing 
circumstances arising from any possible change in control of the 
Company.  

		In order to induce you to remain in the employ of the 
Company, the Company has determined to enter into this letter 
agreement (this "Agreement") which addresses the terms and 
conditions of your employment in the event of a change in control of 
the Company.  Capitalized words which are not otherwise defined 
herein shall have the meanings assigned to such words in Section 8 
of this Agreement.  

		1.	Term of Employment Under the Agreement.  The 
term of your employment under this Agreement shall commence on 
the Change in Control Date and shall continue until the second 
anniversary of the Change in Control Date (the "Term").  

		2.	Employment During the Term.  During the Term, 
the following terms and conditions shall apply to your employment 
with the Company: 

		(a)	Titles; Reporting and Duties.  Your position, titles, 
nature and status of responsibilities and reporting obligations shall 
be no less favorable to you than those that you enjoyed immediately 
prior to the Change in Control Date.  

		(b)	Salary and Bonus.   Your base salary and annual 
bonus opportunity may not be reduced, and your base salary shall be 
periodically reviewed and increased in the manner commensurate 
with increases awarded to other similarly situated executives of the 
Company.
  


		(c)	Incentive Compensation.  You shall be eligible to 
participate in each long-term incentive plan or arrangement established by 
the Company for its executive employees, in accordance with the terms and 
provisions of such plan or arrangement and at a level consistent with the 
Company's practices applicable to you prior to the Change in Control Date. 
				34
<PAGE>		
(d)	Benefits.  You shall be eligible to participate in all 
pension, welfare and fringe benefit plans and arrangements that the 
Company provides to its executive employees in accordance with the 
terms of such plans and arrangements, which shall be no less 
favorable to you, in the aggregate, than the terms and provisions 
available to other executive employees of the Company.  

		(e)	Location.  You will continue to be employed at the 
business location at which you were employed prior to the Change in 
Control Date and the amount of time that you are required to travel 
for business purposes will not be increased in any significant respect 
from the amount of business travel required of you prior to the 
Change in Control Date.  

		3.	Involuntary Termination During the Term.

		(a)	Severance Payment.  In the event of your 
Involuntary Termination during the Term, the Company shall pay 
you within 5 days of the date of such Involuntary Termination the 
full amount of any earned but unpaid base salary through the Date of 
Termination at the rate in effect at the time of the Notice of 
Termination, plus a cash payment (calculated on the basis of your 
Reference Salary) for all unused vacation time which you may have 
accrued as of the Date of Termination.  The Company shall also pay 
you within 5 days of the Date of Termination a pro rata portion of 
the annual bonus for the year in which your Involuntary 
Termination occurs, calculated on the basis of your target bonus for 
that year and on the assumption that all performance targets have 
been or will be achieved.   In addition, the Company shall pay you in 
a cash lump sum, within 8 days following the date of your execution 
of the release described in the last sentence of this Section 3(a) (or 
on the Date of Termination, if later), an amount (the "Severance 
Payment") equal to the sum of (i) three times your Reference Salary 
and (ii) three times your Reference Bonus.  The Severance Payment 
shall be in lieu of any other severance payments which you are 
entitled to receive under any other severance pay plan or 
arrangement sponsored by the Company and its subsidiaries.  Your 
right to the Severance Payment shall be conditioned upon your 
execution of a release in favor of the Company in substantially the 
form of the release required for the receipt of severance payments 
under the Severance Plan (as in effect on the date of this Agreement) 
which is not revoked by you within the seven-day revocation period 
specified therein.

		(b)	Benefit Payment.  In the event of your Involuntary 
Termination during the Term, you and your eligible dependents shall 
continue to be eligible to participate during the Benefit Continuation 
Period (as hereinafter defined) in the medical, dental, health, life and 
other fringe benefit plans and arrangements applicable to you 
immediately prior to your Involuntary Termination on the same 
terms and conditions in effect for you and your dependents 
immediately prior to such Involuntary Termination.  For purposes of 
the previous sentence, "Benefit Continuation Period" means the 
period beginning on the Date of Termination and ending on the 
earlier to occur of (i) the second anniversary of the Date of 
Termination and (ii) the date that you and your dependents are 
eligible and elect coverage under the plans of a subsequent employer 
which provide substantially equivalent or greater benefits to you 
and your dependents.  

		(c)	Date and Notice of Termination.  Any termination 
of your employment by the Company or by you during the Term shall be 
communicated by a notice of termination to the other party hereto (the 
"Notice of Termination").  The Notice of Termination shall indicate the 
specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set 
forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a 
basis for termination of your employment under the provision so indicated.  
The date of your termination of employment with the Company and its 
subsidiaries (the "Date of Termination") shall be determined as follows:  
(i) if your employment is terminated for Disability, thirty (30) days after
a Notice of Termination is given (provided that you shall not have 
returned to the full-time performance of your duties during such 
thirty (30) day period), (ii) if your employment is terminated by the 
Company in an Involuntary Termination, five (5) days after the date 
the Notice of Termination is received by you and (iii) if your 
employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, the later of the 
				35
<PAGE>
date specified in the Notice of Termination or ten (10) days following 
the date such notice is received by you.  If the basis for your 
Involuntary Termination is your resignation for Good Reason, the 
Date of Termination shall be ten (10) days after the date your Notice 
of Termination is received by the Company.  The Date of Termination 
for a resignation of employment other than for Good Reason shall be 
the date set forth in the applicable notice, which shall be no earlier 
than ten (10) days after the date such notice is received by the 
Company.  

		(d)	No Mitigation or Offset.  You shall not be required 
to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this 
Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the 
amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this Agreement be 
reduced by any compensation earned by you as the result of 
employment by another employer or by pension benefits paid by the 
Company or another employer after the Date of Termination or 
otherwise except as specifically provided in clause (ii) of the last 
sentence of Section 3(b).  

		4.	Additional Payment.  

		(a)	Gross-Up Payment.  Notwithstanding anything 
herein to the contrary, if it is determined that any Payment would be 
subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any 
interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, 
together with any interest or penalties thereon, is herein referred to 
as an "Excise Tax"), then you shall be entitled to an additional 
payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount that will place you in 
the same after-tax economic position that you would have enjoyed if 
the Excise Tax had not applied to the Payment.  The amount of the 
Gross-Up Payment shall be determined by the Accounting Firm in 
accordance with the formula {(E x (1 - M)/(1 - T)) -E} (or such other 
formula as the Accounting Firm deems appropriate which is intended 
to achieve the same result), where 

	E  equals the Payments which are determined to be 
	   "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 
	   280G(b)(1) of the Code; 

	M  equals the sum of the highest marginal rates (to be expressed in up 
	   to three decimal places.  For example, a combined federal, state and
           local marginal rate of 56% would be expressed as .560) for Taxes 
	   applicable to you at the time of the Payment; and 

	T  equals M plus the rate of Excise Tax applicable to 
           the Payment.



No Gross-Up Payments shall be payable hereunder if the Accounting 
Firm determines that the Payments are not subject to an Excise Tax.  

		(b)	Determination of Gross-Up Payment.  Subject to 
the provisions of Section 4(c), all determinations required under this 
Section 4, including whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of 
the Payments constituting excess parachute payments, and the amount of the 
Gross-Up Payment, shall be made by the Accounting Firm, which shall provide 
detailed supporting calculations both to you and the Company within fifteen 
days of the Change in Control Date, your Date of Termination or any other date 
reasonably requested by you or the Company on which a determination under 
this Section 4 is necessaryor advisable.  The Company shall pay to you the 
initial Gross-Up Payment within 5 days of the receipt by you and the Company
of the Accounting Firm's determination.  If the Accounting Firm determines 
that no Excise Tax is payable by you, the Company shall cause the Accounting
Firm to provide you with an opinion that the Accounting Firm has substantial
authority under the Code and Regulations not to report an Excise Tax on your
federal income tax return.  Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall 
be binding upon you and the Company.  If the initial Gross-Up Payment is 
insufficient to cover the amount of the Excise Tax that is ultimately 
determined to be owing by you with respect to any Payment (hereinafter an 
"Underpayment"), the Company, after exhausting its 
				36
<PAGE>
remedies under Section 4(c) below, shall promptly pay to you an additional
Gross-Up Payment in respect of the Underpayment.  

		(c)	Procedures.  You shall notify the Company in 
writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if 
successful, would require the payment by the Company of a Gross-Up 
Payment.  Such notice shall be given as soon as practicable after you 
know of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of 
the claim and the date on which the claim is requested to be paid.  
You agree not to pay the claim until the expiration of the thirty-day 
period following the date on which you notify the Company, or such 
shorter period ending on the date the Taxes with respect to such 
claim are due (the "Notice Period"). If the Company notifies you in 
writing prior to the expiration of the Notice Period that it desires to 
contest the claim, you shall:  (i) give the Company any information 
reasonably requested by the Company relating to the claim; (ii) take 
such action in connection with the claim as the Company may 
reasonably request, including, without limitation, accepting legal 
representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably 
selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to you; 
(iii) cooperatewith the Company in good faith in contesting the claim; 
and (iv) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings 
relating to the claim.  You shall permit the Company to control all 
proceedings related to the claim and, at its option, permit the 
Company to pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, 
proceedings, hearings, and conferences with the taxing authority in 
respect of such claim.  If requested by the Company, you agree either 
to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in 
any permissible manner and to prosecute such contest to a 
determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial 
jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts as the Company shall 
determine; provided, however, that, if the Company directs you to 
pay such claim and pursue a refund, the Company shall advance the 
amount of such payment to you on an after-tax and interest-free 
basis (the "Advance").  The Company's control of the contest related 
to the claim shall be limited to the issues related to the Gross-Up 
Payment and you shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case 
may be, any other issues raised by the Internal Revenue Service or 
other taxing authority.  If the Company does not notify you in 
writing prior to the end of the Notice Period of its desire to contest 
the claim, the Company shall pay to you an additional Gross-Up 
Payment in respect of the excess parachute payments that are the 
subject of the claim, and you agree to pay the amount of the Excise 
Tax that is the subject of the claim to the applicable taxing authority 
in accordance with applicable law.

		(d)	Repayments.  If, after receipt by you of an 
Advance, you become entitled to a refund with respect to the claim 
to which such Advance relates, you shall pay the Company the 
amount of the refund (together with any interest paid or credited 
thereon after Taxes applicable thereto).  If, after receipt by you of an 
Advance, a determination is made that you shall not be entitled to 
any refund with respect to the claim and the Company does not 
promptly notify you of its intent to contest the denial of refund, then 
the amount of the Advance shall not be required to be repaid by you 
and the amount thereof shall offset the amount of the additional 
Gross-Up Payment then owing to you.

		(e)	Further Assurances.  The Company shall 
indemnify you and hold you harmless, on an after-tax basis, from 
any costs, expenses, penalties, fines, interest or other liabilities 
("Losses") incurred by you with respect to the exercise by the 
Company of any of its rights under this Section 4, including, without 
limitation, any Losses related to the Company's decision to contest a 
claim or any imputed income to you resulting from any Advance or 
action taken on your behalf by the Company hereunder.  The 
Company shall pay all legal fees and expenses incurred under this 
Section 4, and shall promptly reimburse you for the reasonable 
expenses incurred by you in connection with any actions taken by 
the Company or required to be taken by you hereunder.  The 
Company shall also pay all of the fees and expenses of the 
Accounting Firm, including, without limitation, the fees and expenses 
related to the opinion referred to in Section 4(b).  

		(f)	Combined Payments.  Anything in this Section 4 
to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall have no 
				37
<PAGE>

obligation to pay you a required Gross-Up Payment under this 
Section 4 if the aggregate amount of all Combined Payments has, at 
the time such payment is due, exceeded the Limit.  If the amount of 
a Gross-Up Payment to you under this Section 4 would result in the 
Combined Payments exceeding the Limit, the Company shall pay you 
only the portion, if any, of the Gross-Up Payment which can be paid 
to you without causing the aggregate amount of all Combined 
Payments to exceed the Limit. In the event that you are entitled to a 
Gross-Up Payment under this Section 4 and other employees or 
former employees of the Company are also entitled to gross-up 
payments under the corresponding provisions of the applicable 
Combined Arrangements and the aggregate amount of all such 
payments would cause the Limit on Combined Payments to be 
exceeded, the Company shall allocate the amount of the 
reduction necessary to comply with the Limit among all such 
payments in the proportion that the amount of each such gross-up 
payment or Gross-Up Payment bears to the aggregate amount of all 
such payments.  Nothingin this Section 4(f) shall require you to repay 
to the Company any amount that was previously paid to you under 
this Section 4.

		5.	Other Provisions.  

		(a)	Vesting and Exercise.  All Equity Awards granted 
to you under the Equity Plans shall vest and become exercisable in 
the event of your Involuntary Termination on or following the 
Change in Control Date.  If you are employed by the Company on the 
date of the Equity Plan Change in Control, your Equity Awards will 
vest and become  exercisable as of such date.  

		(b)	Effect of 30-Day Alternative.  In accordance with 
the terms of the Equity Plans, upon an Equity Plan Change in Control, 
Equity Awards which are options or stock appreciation rights are 
"cashed out," unless the Administrator in its discretion determines 
not to do so.  In the event that the Administrator elects not to cash 
out such Equity Awards, the Administrator has the discretion in the 
context of a merger or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of 
the Company either (i) to cause such Equity Awards to be assumed or 
an equivalent option or stock appreciation right granted by the 
successor corporation to the Company or a parent or subsidiary of 
such successor corporation, or (ii) to provide that your Equity 
Awards will remain outstanding for a thirty-day period beginning on 
the date that you are so notified of such action by the Administrator 
and that such Equity Awards will expire to the extent not exercised 
at the end of such thirty-day period (the "30-Day Alternative").  
If the Administrator determines to utilize the 30-Day Alternative, 
the Company shall pay you with respect to each such Equity Award 
the excess, if any (the "Additional Amount"), of the Change in Control 
Price you would have received had the Equity Award been cashed 
out on the date of the Equity Plan Change in Control over the value of 
the consideration actually received by you in settlement of such 
awards (determined as of the date such consideration is received by 
you).  Further, in the event of your Involuntary Termination on or 
after the Change in Control Date but on or prior to the date of the 
Equity Plan Change in Control, the Company shall pay you the 
Additional Amount as if your employment had continued through 
the date of the Equity Plan Change in Control.  In either case, the 
payment of the Additional Amount shall be made within 5 days 
following the determination by the Administrator of the Change in 
Control Price.  

		(c)	General.  Anything in this Agreement to the 
contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the vesting and 
exercisability provisions applicable to you under the terms of your 
Equity Awards be less favorable to you than the terms and 
provisions of such awards in effect on the date hereof.
				38
<PAGE>
		6.	Legal Fees and Expenses.  The Company shall pay 
or reimburse you on an after-tax basis for all costs and expenses 
(including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable legal fees 
and expenses which reflect common practice with respect to the 
matters involved) incurred by you as a result of any claim, action or 
proceeding (i) arising out of your termination of employment during 
the Term, (ii) contesting, disputing or enforcing any right, benefits or 
obligations under this Agreement or (iii) arising out of or challenging 
the validity, advisability or enforceability of this Agreement or any 
provision thereof; provided, however, that the amount of the 
payments and reimbursements under this Section 6 shall not exceed 
$2 million.

		7.	Successors; Binding Agreement.

		(a)	Assumption by Successor.  The Company will 
require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, 
merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the 
business or assets of the Company expressly to assume and to agree to perform 
this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company 
would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place; provided,
however, that no such assumption shall relieve the Company of its obligations 
hereunder.  As used in this Agreement, the "Company" shall mean the Company as 
hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as 
aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of 
law or otherwise.  

		(b)	Enforceability; Beneficiaries.  This Agreement shall 
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of you (and your personal 
representatives and heirs) and the Company and any organization 
which succeeds to substantially all of the business or assets of the Company, 
whether by means of merger, consolidation, acquisition of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company or otherwise, including, without limitation, 
as a result of a Change in Control or by operation of law.  This Agreement 
shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by your personal or legal
representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, 
devisees and legatees. If you should die while any amount would still be 
payable to you hereunder if you had continued to live, all such amounts, 
unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms
 of this Agreement to yourdevisee, legatee or other designee or, if there is
 no such designee, to your estate.

perform your duties with the Company (other than any such failure resulting
from your incapacity due to physical or mental illness or any such actual or
anticipated failure resulting from a resignation by you for Good Reason) after
a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board, 
which demand specifically identifies the manner in which the Board believes 
that you have not substantially performed your duties, and which performance 
is not substantially corrected by you within 10 days of receipt of such 
demand.  For purposes of the previous sentence, no act or failure to act on 
your part shall be deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by you 
not in good faith and without reasonable belief that your action or omission 
was in the best interest of the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you 
shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there 
shall have been delivered to you a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the 
affirmative vote of not less than three-fourths (3/4ths) of the entire 
membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such 
purpose (after reasonable 
notice to you and an opportunity for you, together with your counsel, to be 
heard before the Board), finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board 
you were guilty of conduct set forth above in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the 
first sentence of this section and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

		 "Change in Control" shall mean a change in control of the 
Company of a nature that would be required to be reported in 
response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the 
Exchange Act, whether or not the Company is then subject to such reporting 
requirement; provided, however, that, anything in this Agreement to the 
contrary notwithstanding, a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred
if:
  
	(i)	any individual, partnership, firm, corporation, 
association, trust, unincorporated organization or other entity or 
person, or any syndicate or group deemed to be a person under 
Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act, is or becomes the 
"beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the General Rules 
and Regulations under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of 
securities of the Company representing 30% or more of the 
combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding 
securities entitled to vote in the election of directors of the 
Company;
  
	(ii)	during any period of two (2) consecutive years (not 
including any period prior to the execution of this Agreement), 
individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the

nomination for election by the Company's stockholders was 
approved by a vote of at least three-fourths (3/4ths) of the 
directors then still in office who either were directors at the 
beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for 
election was previously so approved (the "Incumbent Directors"), 
cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof;
  
	(iii)	there occurs a reorganization, merger, 
consolidation or other corporate transaction involving the 
Company (a "Transaction"), in each case with respect to which the 
stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such 
Transaction do not, immediately after the Transaction, own more

corporation resulting from such Transaction;

	(iv)	all or substantially all of the assets of the Company

which would result in a Change in Control and (iv) the date the Company fails
to satisfy its obligations to have this agreement assumed by any successor to
the Company in accordance with Section 7(a) of this Agreement.  If the Change 
in Control Date occurs as a result of an agreement described in clause (ii) of 
the previous sentence or as a result of the approval of the Board described in 
clause (iii) of the previous sentence and the Change in Control to which such 
agreement or approval relates (the "Contemplated Change in Control") 
subsequently does not occur, then the Term shall expire on the sixtieth day 
(the "Reset Date") following the date the Board certifies by resolution duly
adopted by three-fourths (3/4ths) of the Incumbent Directors then in office 
that the Contemplated Change in Control is not reasonably likely to occur; 
provided, however, that this sentence shall not apply if (A) an Involuntary 
Termination of your employment with the Company has occurred on and after the 
Change in Control Date and on or prior to the Reset Date or (B) the 
Contemplated Change in Control subsequently occurs within three months of the 
Reset Date.  Following the Reset Date, the provisions of this Agreement 
shall remain in effect and a new Term shall commence upon the 
occurrence of a subsequent Change in Control Date.  Notwithstanding the first
sentence of this definition, if your employment with the Company terminates 
prior to the Change in Control Date and it is reasonably demonstrated that your
termination of employment (i) was at the request of the third party who has 
taken steps reasonably calculated to effect the Change in Control or 
(ii) otherwise arose in connection with or in anticipation of the Change in 
Control, then "Change in Control Date" shall mean the date immediately prior 
to the date of your termination of employment.

and effect.

several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original 
but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.
